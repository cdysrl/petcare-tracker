    ## Description

    This web application was developed to help pet owners keep track of their pets and any of their care needs. It was designed with having a pet sitter in mind, 
    when the owner is unavailable. The application gives the ability to remind the owner or petsitters of tasks and their frequencies as needed (e.g. medications, feeding, grooming)
    The application helps solve the difficulty in organization for owners with multiple pets that have a variety of care needs.
